# Djfans

![Image](/images/skills.png)


## Personal project for Onlyfans clone

I created a simple onlyfans site using Django. During the deployment process, it was containerized through Docker. I linked the NGINX server and Django application server through Docker Compose. I created AWS resources using Terraform. Build automation was done through the linkage between Docker Hub and GitHub.
I plan to automate deployment by running Jenkins containers on the server.

- Secret value management
By setting the environment variable reference in the container, it is possible to manage secret value management on the server side at once. 

- VPC and Security group
Secure data storage by separating the database and the S3 bucket from the EC2 instance and placing it in a different security group.

- Infrastructure as code
Resource management through Terraform makes it easy to increase/decrease, version control, and reuse servers.

- CI/CD automation (Working on it)
Stage-by-stage setup through the pipeline.
Set to automatically build and deploy at the same time as commit.
